## Create a Microsoft Entra service principal

The Microsoft Entra service principal can be created through the [Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) or programmatically, as in the following example.

This service principal is the identity used by the connector to write data to your table in Kusto. You grant permissions for this service principal to access Kusto resources.

[!INCLUDE [entra-service-principal](../entra-service-principal.md)]

## Create a target table

Create a target table for the incoming data and an ingestion mapping to map the ingested data columns to the columns in the target table.

1. Run the following [table creation command](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/create-table-command) in your query editor, replacing the placeholder *TableName* with the name of the target table:

    ```kusto
    .create table <TableName> (_raw: string, _time: long, cribl_pipe: dynamic)
    ```

1. Run the following [create ingestion mapping](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/create-ingestion-mapping-command) command, replacing the placeholders *TableName* with the target table name and *TableNameMapping* with the name of the ingestion mapping:

    ```kusto
    .create table <TableName> ingestion csv mapping '<TableNameMapping>' 'CriblLogMapping' '[{"Name":"_raw","DataType":"string","Ordinal":"0","ConstValue":null},{"Name":"_time","DataType":"long","Ordinal":"1","ConstValue":null},{"Name":"cribl_pipe","DataType":"dynamic","Ordinal":"2","ConstValue":null}]'
    ```

1. Grant the service principal from [Create a Microsoft Entra service principal](#create-a-microsoft-entra-service-principal) [database ingestor](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/access-control/role-based-access-control) role permissions to work with the database. For more information, see [Examples](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/management/manage-database-security-roles). Replace the placeholder *DatabaseName* with the name of the target database and *ApplicationID* with the `AppId` value you saved when creating a Microsoft Entra service principal.

    ```kusto
    .add database <DatabaseName> ingestors ('aadapp=<ApplicationID>') 'App Registration'
    ```

## Create Cribl Stream destination

The following section describes how to create a Cribl Stream destination that writes data to your table in Kusto. Each table requires a separate Cribl Stream destination connector.

### Select destination

To connect Cribl Stream to your table:

1. From the top navigation in Cribl, select **Manage** then select a Worker Group.

1. Select **Routing** > **QuickConnect (Stream)** > **Add Destination**. 

1. In the **Set up new QuickConnect Destination** window, choose **Azure Data Explorer**, then **Add now**.
